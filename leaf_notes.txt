- Starlight fixlight command + method on light engine (note: add to mod to, after done this)
- note: for paper, the chunk debug command
- rebase IntervalledCounter into util patch
- mcutil diff
- paper debug chunks --async in DedicatedServer
- TODO keep around region file lock?
- mcutil#getTicketLevelFor is wrong, just delete it later
- in the mod:
  - ChunkHolder
    - isReadyForSaving overwrite
    - remove state fields in mod
    - addSaveDependency overwrite
  - ChunkMap
    - pendingUnloads/pendingGenerationTasks/unloadQueue/ field destroy
  - DistanceManager
    - getTickets/dumpTickets/tickingTracker/ overwrite
  - GenerationChunkHolder
    - remove state fields in mod
    - rescheduleChunkTask/failAndClearPendingFuturesBetween/failAndClearPendingFuture/completeFuture/
      findHighestStatusWithPendingFuture/acquireStatusBump/isStatusDisallowed/ overwrite
  - LayerLightEngine
    - getDebugSectionType overwrite
  - ThreadedLayerLightEngine
    - waitForPendingTasks overwrite

on another note, clean up mcutils...

later, run a diff compared to the mod and move all of the diff to separate classes
apply todo in levelmixin

to fix later:
- Change loadedChunkMap in ServerChunkCache to use concurrent long map
