Subject: [PATCH] Optimize Captured TileEntity Lookup

upstream was doing a containsKey/get pattern, and always doing it at that.
that scenario is only even valid if were in the middle of a block place.

Optimize to check if the captured list even has values in it, and also to
just do a get call since the value can never be null.
